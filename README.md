# CS162_G1_Pred_Prey
A collaborative project based on a a 2D predatorâ€“prey simulation. The preys are ants and the predators are doodlebugs. Most of my original code was used for the project, however some small changes were made prior to completion. The code included in this repository is strictly my work.
